# Match LMS Release Action

This GitHub action automatically increments the package version to match a given LMS release and creates an appropriate tag.

## Using the Action

Typically this action is triggered from a workflow that runs on your `main` or `master` branch after each commit or pull request merge.

Here's a sample release workflow:

```yml
name: Release
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
      - main
      - '[0-9]+.x'
      - '[0-9]+.[0-9]+.x'
      - release/[0-9]+.[0-9]+.x
jobs:
  release:
    if: "!contains(github.event.head_commit.message, 'skip ci')"
    timeout-minutes: 2
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: Brightspace/third-party-actions@actions/checkout
      - name: Setup Node
        uses: Brightspace/third-party-actions@actions/setup-node
      - name: Match LMS Release
        id: matchlmsrelease
        uses: Scy-D2L/action-testing/match-lms-release@main
        with:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.D2L_GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          RALLY_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.RALLY_API_KEY }}
```

Options:
* `AUTO_MAINTENANCE_BRANCH` (default: `true`): Automatically create maintenance branches for previous releases. These branches will be named `release/{realease version}.x` (ex: 2022.1.x)
* `DRY_RUN` (default: `false`): Simulates a release but does not actually do one
* `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Token to use to update version in 'package.json' and create the tag -- see section below on branch protection for more details
* `RALLY_API_KEY`: Key for the RALLY API (used to retrieve active development release)

Outputs:
* `VERSION`: will contain the new version number of the release

### Branch Protection Rules and D2L_GITHUB_TOKEN

The release step will fail to write to `package.json` if you have branch protection rules set up in your repository. To get around this, we use a special Admin `D2L_GITHUB_TOKEN`.

[Learn how to set up the D2L_GITHUB_TOKEN...](../docs/branch-protection.md)

## Release Increments
The first commit made during any given LMS release will update the Major and/or Minor versions to match the LMS version provided. Other commits during the same LMS release will trigger patch releases.
